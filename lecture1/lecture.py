Lecture 1: Introduction to data processing pipelines

=== Poll ===

Today's poll is to help me understand your background in Python and command line/Git.
(I will also ask about your background in HW0.)

https://forms.gle/h53wSrkeaM4R28Gu9
https://tinyurl.com/ypevcu9u

=== Following along ===

Try this!

1. You will need to have Git installed (typically installed with Xcode on Mac, or with Git for Windows). Follow the guide here:

    https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git

    Feel free to work on this as I am talking and to get help from your neighbors.
    I can help with any issues after class.

2. You will also need to create an account on GitHub and log in.

3. Go to: https://github.com/DavisPL-Teaching/119

4. If that's all set up, then click the green "Code" button, click "SSH", and click to copy the command:

    git@github.com:DavisPL-Teaching/119.git

5. Open a terminal and type:

    git clone git@github.com:DavisPL-Teaching/119.git

6. Type `ls`.

    You should see a new folder called "119" in your home folder. This contains the lecture notes and source files for the class.

7. Type `cd `119/lecture1`, then type `ls`.
   Lastly type `python3 lecture.py`. You should see the message below.
"""

print("Hello, ECS 119!")

If some step above didn't work, you may be missing some of the software we
need installed. Please complete HW0 first and then let us know if you
are still having issues.

=== The basics ===

I will introduce the class through a basic overview, or "toy model"
of what a data procesisng pipeline is. Throughout, we will also see
some of the constraints that data processing pipelines have to satisfy,
how they interact with one another, and so on.
This will lead to an overview of topics covered in the class.

Recall "discussion scenarios" from the previous lecture.

EXAMPLE 1:
I have a spreadsheet containing 1000 movies I have seen or want to see,
dates watched, and movie ratings.
I built a Python application which loads the spreadsheet,
filters out movies based on a recently viewed or highest-rated sorting,
and allows me to mark a movie as seen or to edit any movie ratings.
It also collects statistics about all the movies.
All of this data is then saved back to the spreadsheet.

EXAMPLE 2:
I have written a website scraper that reads data from Wikipedia.
I re-run the scraper every week to get the latest data.
It opens up all Wikipedia sites that correspond to cities in the world,
extracts the population of each city, the area, and the country it is located
in. Once all of this data is collected, it stores it in a structured
format and saves it to a database, then queries the database for the
top 100 most population-dense cities and outputs these to a file
biggest_cities.txt.

What do these scenarios have in common?
Suggestions:
- Write the data to CSV
- ...

3 stages -- related to something called the "Extract, Transform, Load" model (ETL)

What are the components of a data processing pipeline?

0. Description of the task that you want to complete.
1. Input source -- get your input from somewhere
2. Processing stage -- do some transformations on your data,
    add additional data fields, modify fields, calculate summary
    statistics, etc.
3. Output -- save the results to a file or a database; display
    them to the user; etc.

# # (Side note on gitignore)

"""
Graphical view

We can view all of the above steps as something called
a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
What do I mean and how?

It's a flow chart of input sources,
processing stages (often called "operators"),
and outputs.

                       -> min ->
(life-expectancy.csv)  -> max ->  output.csv
                       -> avg ->

Why is this useful?

- We'll use this to think about parallelism
- We'll use this to think about performance.

=== Recap of what we covered today ===

- Any data processing pipeline can be thought of as having 3 stages:
    input source, processing, and output
- Data processing pipelines can be drawn as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).

=======================================================================

=== Monday, September 30 ===

(See README.md for announcements and plan.)

=== A tangent on pacing ===

- The pacing might be a bit slow right now for some of you -- especially if you have prior experience
  with Python, pandas, Git, etc.
  (HW0 results so far: 100% have used Python, 80% Pandas, 75% Git)

- We do have varying levels of background including some who have not used some of these tools
  before. So please be patient with us for the first few lectures.

- 80% of you have only limited experience with command line in particular, so we will spend some additional
  time in Lecture 2 on software development tools.

- There will be a mid-quarter survey (around 4 weeks in) to see if we are going too slow or too fast
  and I will adjust things accordingly!

If you already cloned the repo, then this time, you need to get any code updates.
Do the following:

- git status
- git stash
- git pull

=== Poll ===

1. Which stage do you think is likely to be the most computationally intensive part of a data processing pipeline?

2. Which ostage do you think is likely to present the biggest opportunity for failure cases, including crashes, ethical concerns or bias, or unexpected/wrong/faulty data?

=== Data processing pipelines as software ===

Some of you may know about tools like Jupyter notebooks, Google Colab, or Excel.
(What is the most widely used data processing tool? Answer: ____)

So why aren't we using those tools? :)

In this course, I want to encourage us to think about data processing pipelines as real software.
That means:
- Software *design* matters: structuring code into modules, classes, functions
- Software can be *tested*: validating functions, validating inputs, unit & integration tests
- Software can be *reused* and maintained (not just a one-off script)
- Software can be developed collaboratively (Git, GitHub)
- Software can be optimized for performance (parallelism, distributed computing, etc.)

It is a little more work to structure our code this way!
But it helps ensure that our work is reusable and integrates well with other teams, projects, etc.

Let's consider how to write the minimal data processing pipeline we saw last time
as a more structured software pipeline.

In the second stage, we said that one thing that could

One aspect of particular interest to us in this class is the performance in the second
stage. How do we measure performance?

=== Performance ===

Three key performance metrics:

- Throughput

- Latency

- Memory usage

Let's measure the performance of our toy pipeline.

Timeit:
https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html

Example syntax:
timeit.timeit('"-".join(str(n) for n in range(100))', number=10000)

=== Closing quotes ===

From Patrice Koehl:
https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~koehl/:

    "Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge?
    Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?
    Where is the information we have lost in data?"

    With apologies to T.S. Eliot.

Data processing is all about extracting wisdom from data.
But each of these steps can go wrong!

From Edsgar Dijkstra:

    "Simplicity is a great virtue but it requires hard work to achieve it and education to appreciate it. And to make matters worse: complexity sells better."

I'd like to encourage us to think about how to build pipelines that are as *simple* as possible
-- organized into careful components, with helpful abstractions -- rather than having
expanding components and needless complexity.

Why? Simpler pipelines are more reliable, easier to develop, easier to understand, and easier to maintain.

Tools are adopted not just because of what they can do, but because of how much they can do in the most
intuitive and direct way possible.

The tools we see in this class will help us achieve the right abstractions to achieve this simplicity.
